          <p>Hello! I am Axodouble.<br />
            I am a Netherlands-based Developer and specialize primarily in making reliable back-end infrastructure.
            As you might be able to tell I have less experience in front-end design as much as I hate to admit;
            however I do pride myself in my ability to create reliable infrastructure to support large operations.
            I host a significant amount of my services locally as a platform to develop on.
            This not only cuts down costs but also allows me to work with and learn other platforms of infrastructure.
            <br /><br />
            I have been working with computers for as long as I can remember as I was born around the advent of modern
            internet infrastructure. Over the years I have spent a significant amount of time in communities to learn-
            more about the general infrastructure of the modern web; this has given me the ability to work in different-
            positions with companies that require a more specialized and reliable approach to their internet infrastructure.
