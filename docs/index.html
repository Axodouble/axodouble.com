    <h2>About Me</h2>
    Axodouble is the online name used by Jasper for creative projects or online
    contact.<br>
    I am a Netherlands-based Developer and specialize primarily in making reliable back-end infrastructure.
    <br><br>
    I have been working with computers for as long as I can remember, this was aided by the fact I was born around
    the
    advent of modern
    internet infrastructure.
    <br><br>Over the years I have spent a significant amount of time in communities to learn
    more about the general infrastructure of the modern web; this has given me the ability to work in different
    positions with companies that require a more specialized and reliable approach to their internet
    infrastructure.<br>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    As you might be able to tell I have less experience in front-end design as much as I hate to admit;<br>
    however I do pride myself in my ability to create reliable infrastructure to support large operations.
    I host a significant amount of my services locally as a platform to develop on.
    This not only cuts down costs but also allows me to work with and learn other platforms of infrastructure.
